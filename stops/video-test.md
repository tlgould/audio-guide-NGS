Welcome to this display of 20th Century Masterpieces of Scottish and European Art, from the collections of the National Galleries of Scotland.

This display of works from the collections offers a historical overview of some of the most remarkable art made in the last century.

Opened in 1960, the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art was the first gallery in Britain dedicated to collecting modern and contemporary art.  Fifty-five years on, many important and world famous works of art have entered the collection including works by Picasso and Matisse, paintings by the Russian artists Mikhail Larionov and Natalya Goncharova, and sculptures by the British artist Henry Moore, all of which are on display.
