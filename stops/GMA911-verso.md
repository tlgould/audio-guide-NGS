*Die Brücke* had been disbanded in 1913, due to internal struggles between members of the group. The outbreak of the First World War shortly followed and marked a major turning point for Kirchner and his work. He found military service highly distressing and descended into a state of anxiety, suffering a nervous breakdown and developing a dependency on sleeping pills and morphine. Eventually in 1917, he moved to Switzerland for treatment, settling in Davos, where in time, his health began to improve. He was to remain in Switzerland for the remainder of his life.

The image painted on the reverse of *Japanese Theatre* in 1924 depicts the interior of Kirchners home in Davos, called the ‘Wildbodenhaus’. It shows a seated nude and a standing male figure, most likely a self-portrait of Kirchner. The painting is structured around horizontal and vertical lines and enlivened by large patterns and intense colours, reflecting the houses decoration of exotic textiles, carpets and Kirchner’s own work.
  
The totemic sculpture seen on the left was probably carved by Kirchner himself. Like several of his contemporaries, he had an interest in primitive sculpture, particularly Pacific sculpture which he had seen in museums during his time in Dresden. He put this interest into practise, carving sculptures and items of furniture directly from tree trunks.

By the time this work was painted, Kirchner had recovered from his drug dependency and achieved official recognition as a major figure in German art, with major museums acquiring his works and being included in exhibitions throughout the 1920’s. 

However, it was not to last. With the rise of the National Socialist party in 1933, Kirchner was denounced as a degenerate artist and 639 of his works were confiscated from museums, being sold abroad or destroyed. He was also expelled from the German Academy of Arts.

This feeling of being ostracised, combined with his still fragile mental state caused him to relapse, afflicted with depression and insomnia. In 1938, after the annexation of Austria, he became disturbed by the prospect of Germany going on to invade Switzerland. This obsession and the damage caused to his mental health came to a tragic head when in June of that year, he committed suicide at the age of 58.
